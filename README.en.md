# cpp programming notes

## Intro

These are some codes from my *Fundamentals of Programming* and *Object-Oriented Programming* classes, which (my codes) are not worth a dime (x).

Anyway, I hope they can help you. I'm sure you'll give me a star (and pigs might fly).

The related notes are available on my personal blog https://yoghurtlee.com.
